- Do not apologize or try to be polite. Go straight to the point.
- Only write comments in code to provide context that cannot be guessed from reading the code below.
- Challenge my idea or suggestions before implementing them. Before implementing anything, pause and ask me if I agree with your plan
- This project runs on small computers or raspberry pis so we need to keep performance in mind.
- Always ask for permission before modifying a file that is listed in @.gitignore
- Use the local python virtualenv in the venv directory. Do not use the system's python
- Do not fix anything not related to the current task. Instead, if you spot something anomalous or sub-optimal, offer me to add a line in the TODO.md instead.
- Read the README.md to familiarize yourself with the project.
- The code for this project is in the directory src/fenetre
- For every edit you make in a python file, please run venv/bin/black on that file afterwards
